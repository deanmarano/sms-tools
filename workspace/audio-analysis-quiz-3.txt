The linearity property of the DFT means that

the DFT is a non-linear operation

we can compute the DFT by summing two signals

x the sum of two signals corresponds to the multiplication of their spectra

:) x the scaled sum of two signals corresponds to the same scaled sum of their spectra

shifting only its magnitude spectrum

x scaling its spectrum by a constant

The operation to express the magnitude spectrum of a signal in decibels is

20*log10(angle(X))

Phase unwrapping is a way to represent the phase spectrum so that

we obtain the exact values of all the phases

x we limit the phase values to the range from 0 to 2pi

:) we obtain a smooth function not bounded to the range 0 to 2pi

x the phase spectrum becomes the same than the magnitude spectrum

Zero-padding the input signal of the DFT permits to

x computer faster the FFT

:) obtain an interpolated spectrum that is easier to study

x have a window size equal to the FFT size

obtain better frequency resolution

8. 
The FFT algorithm is an implementation of the DFT equation that

:) x optimizes calculations by taking advantage of symmetries in the DFT equation

cannot be used in Python so we will have to use the DFT

is able to compute the DFT of real signals

allows to compute the DFT of any size signal

9. 
Zero-phase windowing a signal permits to obtain a spectrum in which

we can discard the phase spectrum and focus on the magnitude

:) x there is no phase offset because the signal is centered around zero

the phase spectrum of any signal is always zero

the phase spectrum is the phase of the window

If we take the DFT of a real signal and then the IDFT of the resulting spectrum, the resulting signal

:) x will be identical to the input signal

will correspond to a few of the sinusoids present in the input signal

will be a complex signal that will represent the spectrum

will be a slightly modified version of the input signal
